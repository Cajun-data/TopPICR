\title{Include additional variables and UniProt accessions}
\usage{
augment_annotation(x, fst_path, fst_name)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{data.table} output from the \code{read_toppic} function.}

\item{fst_path}{A character string specifying the path to the protein
database (.fasta) file.}

\item{fst_name}{A character string containing the name of the .fasta file.}
}
\value{
A \code{data.table} with all protein accessions that match each amino
acid sequence, not just the highest scoring accession. The number of rows
in the output could be much larger than the number of rows in the input
because all accessions for each sequence are included. The following
variables have been added/removed:\tabular{ll}{
   Added \tab Removed \cr
   \code{cleanSeq} \tab  \cr
   \code{AccMap} \tab  \cr
   \code{UniProtAcc} \tab  \cr
   \code{protLength} \tab  \cr
   \code{firstAA} \tab  \cr
   \code{lastAA} \tab  \cr
   \code{AnnType} \tab  \cr
   \code{PercentCoverage} \tab  \cr
}
}
\description{
All UniProt accessions that match each amino acid sequence will be added to
the \code{data.table}. Currently the \code{data.table} only consits of the
highest scoring UniProt accession for each amino acid sequence. Additional
variables are also created from the current variables.
